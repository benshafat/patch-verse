# patch-verse

This code was worked on as part of a home-exam, trying to implement the Adversarial Patch algorithm 
for attacking image classification models.

The core of the code here is the code in https://github.com/jhayes14/adversarial-patch

The code assumes you have an imagenet directory setup for image sampling. See the original project for details.

Code improvements:
	* Lots of code-smell & bug fixes
	* Object oriented implementation
